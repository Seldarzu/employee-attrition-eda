# 📊 HR Attrition EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing pipeline for employee attrition prediction using the **IBM HR Analytics dataset**.
This project focuses on understanding workforce patterns, feature relationships, and early signals behind employee turnover before modeling.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains two main Jupyter notebooks where the HR dataset is explored, cleaned, and prepared for further machine learning workflows.

The goal is NOT just visualization — but building a **strong analytical foundation** before predictive modeling.

### Core Objectives

✔️ Understand attrition behaviour
✔️ Detect data imbalance and feature distributions
✔️ Identify high-impact variables
✔️ Prepare clean structured data for ML pipelines
✔️ Build reproducible EDA workflow
